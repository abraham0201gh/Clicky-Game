# Clicky-Game

Deployed Link:  

## Overview

This App is a memory game with React. The work involved includes breaking up the application's UI into components, managing component state, and responding to user events.

### Instructions

1. The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

2. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
